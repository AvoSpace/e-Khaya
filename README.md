***
The problem we have identified is the potential corruption in the service delivery of housing.

The solution aims to keep track of the budget allocated,tenders and the contracts for housing by the government being fulfilled.It involves ensuring trust by making the process of house allocation public knowledge using blockchain. Our solution will use a public ledger that will have smart contracts that tie an applicant(with ID number) to a house.
